How to Download the GitHub Material to Your Account
===================================================

Once you are logged in to the server, simply type

  git clone https://github.com/dcastl2/csc1254-sp2016

this will create a folder called ``csc1254-sp2016`` which contains all the
contents of this repository.  This includes binary files for programs.  Change
into the directory ``assg/prog1a/bin``, for example, to get to the for the
binaries for prog1a.  You can execute these binaries to see the expected
program behavior.  You will also find starter codes for assignments. For
example, see ``assg/prog1a/src`` for codes which are useful for completing
the assignment.

From time to time, I will update the repository with more information,
assignments, and notes.  To receive the latest changes, go to the top-level
directory of the repository and simply type

  git pull

Then your copy of the repository will be up-to-date.  If you find the folder
name ``csc1254-sp2016`` to long, you can rename it (to ``repo``, for example),
without affecting anything.  You will still be able to pull changes.
