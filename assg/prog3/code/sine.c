/*
6. Calculating sine.
     [16]. Using OpenMP, write a program which accepts a floating-point number
     as a command-line argument then calculates the sine, cosine, and tangent
     of the number.  Write the function ``double sin(double x)`` which
     calculates the sine of a given argument ``x`` in parallel using the Taylor
     series formula for the sine function.  Obtain the cosine and tangent using
     trigonometric identities.  Output the results.  Call this ``sine.c``.
